# Umde Application

### The project development is still in progress... !!
Online deployment on vercel: https://umde-app.vercel.app/
You can even install the pwa locally by visiting the deployment link.

## Why I'm interested in this project
This is a personal pwa project which I intend to develop for my father's wholesale store. 

## What it can do
It allows products storage, prices, trades, costumers and orders managements. It makes the manager able to:
- Have a list of all products, knowing the prices they bought them, the amount remaining in the storage and the prices for selling to different types of costumers.
- Keep the costumers organized and know the upcoming orders.
- Make trade bills and have a history of payments and debts and loans.

## How to run?
Currently this project only works serverlessly powered by Next-pwa and Web LocalStorage API. You only have to do the followings to run it on your own machine:
- Install Node.js.
- Clone the repository and in the main directory type command: ```$ npm i```
- Start the development server by simply typing: ```$ npm run dev``` and redirect to http://localhost:3000
- Or you can start production server by typing commands: ```$ npm run build``` and then ```$ npm run start``` and redirect to http://localhost:3000
